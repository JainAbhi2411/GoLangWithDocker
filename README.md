🚀 Docker Management Dashboard (MERN + Golang)
A real-time Docker management dashboard built using the MERN stack for the frontend and Go (Golang) for the backend. This project enables users to efficiently manage Docker containers and images with a seamless UI and high-performance API.

🦾 Powered by Golang
The backend is developed in Go (Golang) to ensure high-speed execution, concurrency handling, and optimized performance for Docker operations. Go’s efficiency in handling multiple requests makes this project highly responsive for real-time container management.
